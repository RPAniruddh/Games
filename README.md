# Python Game Collection

This repository contains three Python games: **HangMan**, **Number Guessing**, and **Blackjack**.

## HangMan

This game randomly selects a word and allows the player to guess it letter by letter. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word. The game also includes a graphical representation of the hangman as the player makes incorrect guesses.

## Number Guessing

The computer selects a random number, and the player has to guess it. The game offers two difficulty levels: easy and hard. The player has a limited number of chances to guess correctly.

## Blackjack

This game simulates a simplified version of Blackjack. The player is dealt two cards, and they can choose to take additional cards or stand. The objective is to get a total score as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. The computer also plays based on set rules.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Run the respective game scripts:

   - **HangMan**: `python HangMan.py`
   - **Number Guessing**: `python Number_Guessing.py`
   - **Blackjack**: `python blackjack.py`

3. Follow the on-screen instructions for each game.

Enjoy playing!

## Note

- Make sure to have the required libraries installed (`random`, `os`, `art`).
- Ensure that `hangman_words.py` and `art.py` files are in the same directory as the game scripts.
